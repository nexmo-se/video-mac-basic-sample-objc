# video-mac-basic-sample-objc

Tested on XCode Version 13.4.1 (13F100) running on MacOS 12.6

1. Create a Vonage Video API Account
2. Get an APIKey, Session-ID, Token from Vonage video playground
3. Add these details to ViewController.m and run the sample
4. You can have a two-party video call with the video playground as the second participant.

Notes:

This sample assumes there are only 2 participants in the call. If more than 1 subscriber joins, the behaviour is unexpected.
